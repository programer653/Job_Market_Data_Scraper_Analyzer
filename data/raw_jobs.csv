Software Engineer,Middesk,"About Middesk Middesk makes it easier for businesses to work together. Since 2018, we’ve been transforming business identity verification, replacing slow, manual processes with seamless access to complete, up-to-date data. Our platform helps companies across industries confidently verify business identities, onboard customers faster, and reduce risk at every stage of the customer lifecycle. Middesk came out of Y Combinator, is backed by Sequoia Capital and Accel Partners, and was recently named to Forbes Fintech 50 List and cited as an industry leader in business verification by digital identity strategy firm, Liminal. About Middesk Engineering: We believe ""velocity"" is the rate at which we effect realized value for our customers, not the rate at which we ship code. And this pushes us to center our work around customers; how will this change I'm about to make help our customers get jobs done? When we’re coding, we're making hundreds of micro-decisions about user experience that add up. How can I communicate this exception to our customers in a manner that helps them understand what's happened and unblock themselves? Middesk Engineering is customer-first engineering. (check out our blog post on the topic). The Role: Engineers have the freedom to create a lot of impact for our customers. The role requires high agency and comfort with change. It requires people who believe the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic. It requires Engineers who believe that solving customer problems quickly is what matters first; building scalable systems matters when customer problems are scaling problems. We follow a hybrid work model, and for this role, there is an expectation of 2 days per week in our SF or NYC office. Candidates should be based within a commutable distance, as we believe in the value of in-person collaboration and building strong team connections while also supporting flexibility where possible. What You'll Do: Work in React, Redux, Ruby, Rails, Postgres, and potentially Scala, Python, and Go to solve problems for our customers. Dive into all layers of the stack; frontend, backend, API, data processors, etc. Jam with Product Managers, Designers, Ops, and other Engineers every day to shape the direction of our products. Share your knowledge with others in Engineering; people should get better at their craft because they work with you. Even if you’re early in your career, you have something to teach. Contribute to the psychological safety of your team. Software is built by groups of people, and good relationships matter. Help us interview and hire other Engineers. What We’re Looking For: While we agree the interesting problems in Engineering are stack-agnostic, we’d love it if you had experience with a couple of the languages in our stack (see the first point above). We’ve found that Engineers with prior stack experience usually ramp faster. You’ve worked for a high-growth, venture-backed startup before and are looking for a similar role. Or, you've founded a company and are looking to get back into it. You’ve been working as a professional Software Engineer for at least three or more years. You understand SaaS business fundamentals (e.g. annual contract value, customer acquisition cost, and annual-recurring revenue) and can demonstrate how the work you’ve done influences these metrics.
